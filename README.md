**Introduction:**
X-Wave Viewer is a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to visualize the results of extreme wave event analyses. It serves as a companion tool to X-Wave 1.0.

**Main Features**
Graphical User Interface (GUI): based on uifigure, providing easy navigation for non-programmer users.
Data Input: accepts calculation result files (.mat) from X-Wave 1.0.
Metric Selection: offers options for ave_intens, max_intens, duration, and events.
Spatial Visualization:
Gridding of coordinate data (latitude, longitude, value).
Map plotting with adaptive color scales.
Land shapefile overlay (landareas.shp) for geographic context.
Result Export: automatically saves visualization output in .png format with 300 dpi resolution.
Interactive Notifications: error messages (if a file is not found) and confirmation of successful export.

**Input and Output**
Input:
A data folder containing .mat files generated by X-Wave 1.0.
Data must contain at least three columns: latitude, longitude, and metric values.
Output:
Spatial visualization in the form of maps showing the distribution of extreme metrics.
.png image files for documentation or publication.
